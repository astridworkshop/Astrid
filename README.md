# Astrid

A private, OpenAI-compatible local AI client that works with tools such as LM Studio and other self-hosted model servers.

Your hardware. Your models. Your AI.

## About

Astrid is an iOS app that lets you chat with AI models without sending your data to the cloud. Instead of relying on external services, Astrid connects to a local model server running on your own hardware, keeping all your conversations completely private.

## Requirements

- iPhone running iOS 17.0 or later
- A Mac or other device running an OpenAI-compatible model server (such as LM Studio)
- Both devices on the same local network
